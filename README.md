# About This Repository

This repository is a collection of data files intended to be used
for experimenting with various UNIX filters. They should be used 
in conjunction with the slide set

[Linux Command Line Tutorial](https://github.com/stewartweiss/ossd_slides/blob/master/linux_command_tutorial_01.html)

The `CSV` files are open data from New York City or New York State. The `PHP`

## About the Baby Names Data Set

The rank in the baby names data set is relative to the birth year of the baby,
mother's  ethnicity. and baby's gender.
In other words, for each birth year, and each ethnicity, and each gender, the 
count of the name is used to rank the name - higher count means smaller rank,
with 1 being the highest count.
 
The original file has duplicates. I stripped them in the file in this repository.
