The rank in the baby names data set is relative to the birth year of the baby,
mother's  ethnicity. and baby's gender.
In other words, for each birth year, and each ethnicity, and each gender, the 
count of the name is used to rank the name - higher count means smaller rank,
with 1 being the highest count.
 
The original file has duplicates. I stripped them in the file named baby_names.csv
